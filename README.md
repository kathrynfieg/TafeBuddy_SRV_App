### What problem does it solve

Currently, Tafe students have to manually check their progress by going through the official TAFE SA webiste, looking up their qualification, and cross checking what they have and haven't taken yet - what a hassle! With the new SRV feature, this is all done for them. All they need to do is log in with their organisational account, and click on the 'Student Results View' button.
