# TafeBuddy

TAFE SA - anytime, anywhere. Tafe Buddy is an application developed for students of TAFE SA and allows them to connect to a range of services and resources relevant to their studies.

What's New:

## Introducing the Students Results View (SRV)! 

### What problem does it solve

Currently, Tafe students have to manually check their progress by going through the official TAFE SA webiste, looking up their qualification, and cross checking what they have and haven't taken yet - what a hassle! With the new SRV feature, this is all done for them. All they need to do is log in with their organisational account, and click on the 'Student Results View' button.
